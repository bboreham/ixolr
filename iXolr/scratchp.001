Have a look for a hidden partition. It's fairly common for manaf. to put

Get into the computer bios, and see if the partitions are listed, if so 
you should be able to select which one to boot from.
(Not all bios show this)

Be careful and some rescue partitions give you a couple of options such as 
repair leaving any user data and programs intact, or reset to factory, 
which will zap everything on the C: drive.
 

If the bios does not do the trick, then all you need is a bootable disk  
to get to the command line. So  make a boot disk from another system 
(assuming it has a floppy) or a boot CD with fdisk on it.

Things like norton ghost cd's are bootable, and they have gdisk on them, 
which is a more advanced fdisk type utility.

These will allow you to have a look at the drive and see if there are any 
additional partitions, and if so what is on them. Sometimes they are set 
to hidden, so you will need to reset the hidden flag, to be able to use 
them. 

There are also many system rescue CD's available for download.

I keep a copy of the linux system rescue CD handy for such things.

I also have this on a bootable USB stick

Obviously a XP disk is the easiest, but any of the above methods may work.

Unless you want to do really naughty stuff, the one at sourceforge is

Some AV programs identify it as malware, but you can re-compile it

Well a week of investigating on and off seems to point the finger 
of suspicion towards Humyo Smartdrive (a system tray application that 
automatically synchronizes selected folders on one's computer with the 
on-line storage area):

 (a) there was a managed upgrade of this app from version 2.2.0.7 to
     2.2.0.9 shortly before my problems first arose on 6 March (I've 
     been using it since late January)
 (b) when I disable the automatic loading of the app (or when I exit
     it within about 30 minutes after starting up), the problem does
     not arise
 (c) if the app is still there after about 40-45 minutes, the firewall
     reports numerous incidences of a Windows Fatal Application Exit 
     (I've counted 300 in 2 seconds) 'Too Many Connections' in the 
     Event Viewer - after which occasionally, when a new connection is
     created (as reported by TCPView), a new Fatal Exit occurs.

I had hoped that reinstalling the older version of Humyo (2.2.0.7) would 
fix this problem, but that is not the case - so maybe there is still an 
other reason for the problem (although it does appear that Humyo is at 
least implicated).

What approaches could I use to further investigate this issue?

MTIA.

We all get the dreaded thinking-block from time to time :-)

Once I recollected that when linear length increases x times, area 
increases x^2 times, it was full steam ahead (to pick up your railway 
oriented "buffer" metaphor).

If you really find the equations difficult, fire up a spreadsheet such as 
Excel.

In the first row (1), label the first 4 columns (A--D) "Aspect 1", "Aspect 
2", "Diagonal" and "Area".

In the next row, put 
3       4       10      =C2^2*A2*B2/(A2^2+B2^2)
With most spreadsheets you should get the 48 that petemaud worked out for 
a 3:4 aspect ratio, and can then play with the values.

Haven't changed anything else. 

The boiler thermostat is definitely gone funny. Boiler at full blast
when it is at zero, it switches off (though not all the time) at other
positions.

Now running the boiler manually (switching it off every so often) Don't

Or is it the safety cut-out -- ie, the boiler overheating (hence the funny 
noises) and being shut down automagically. Definitely check there's enough 
water in the system: too little would account for all your symptoms.

>>>diy/3heating 1251 billwill(635)13mar10 1:19 c1243*
When I last did my Garage door. I gripped the shaft with a mole wrench to 
stop it turning.

The carrier for the end of spring has recesses in it into which you can 
insert a narrow steel rod (I used some old twist drills). There are 4 such 
recesses in my carrier, By using two rods you can hold the spring in 
place, lever it around so that you can get a rod into a new recess and 
take out the first rod etc. So a rod can stop the spring carrier turning 
while you loosen its two grub screws.

Then you can progressively wind it up by alternating rods and then 
retighten the grub screws.

Finally release the mole wrench. 

Bill²


>>>diy/3heating 1252 aeskelson(627)13mar10 2:07 c1251*
That's quite a difference.

Was this a roller shutter type door?


My friends door (roller shutter type) was about 12 feet wide 8ft high, the 
spring was inside the roll, one end anchored to the shaft the other to the 
shutter. 

No way would a pair of moles grip the shaft an stop this thing turning. I 
even found it to difficult to put enough force on the stilson to wind up 
the spring after just over 1 turn, I think I would have bent any thin rods.

During install when the door is out of it's tracks, and the shutter roll 
held by ties, you are supposed to rotate the door roll 2 1/2 times to 
tension the spring. 






>>>diy/3heating 1253 billwill(273)13mar10 14:38 c1252*
No, its a typical up & over door.

Operation performed from the inside with the door shut, 

I used a Big mole wrench & clamped very tight. In fact I had to use pliers 
to release the catch on the mole wrench to remove it.

Possibly Rollers have stronger springs.

>>>diy/3heating 1254 tforte(428)13mar10 15:28 c1250
Thanks

The safety cut out thermostat has a reset button, which hasn't tripped.
There is plenty of water in the system. I have bled the radiators as
well. 

From reading various notes on the web, I guess it is either the boiler
thermostat or the "printed circuit"  Is there a way of testing either
independently? 

For example, when the boiler thermostat is in the "0" position, is it an
open or closed electrical circuit?






>>>diy/3heating 1255 aeskelson(108)13mar10 20:07 c1253
Very much so, the spring is holding most of the weight of the shutter, 
which is rather heavy steel.

If you are buying a uPVC or composite door, check the construction very 
carefully.  A uPVC door with a one-piece moulded panel *will* crack and 
leak, as will a composite door of similar construction.  Ideally a uPVC 
door should be constructed like a window, with panels and/or sealed units 
fitting into a frame.  The moulded panels have several problems, quite 
aside from looking cheap!  First, they are sealed to any window with an 
adhesive, and the seal very often breaks down.  Second, the stresses left 
in the material from the moulding process inevitably come back to haunt 
them, and if you look any reasonable sample of such doors you will find 
cracks and splits radiating from the corners of the letter-box and the 
corners of the window.  Composite doors are OK if the panel is in GRP 
(fibreglass to old-timers like me!), which is laid down in the mould 
rather than being heat- and stress-moulded, and if the design avoids the 
need to glue the panel to the glass ...

A *good* hardwood door would be an excellent choice, though it is likely 
to cost several times as much as any other type of door.

Again, remember you get what you pay for, and buying on price rather than 
quality is always going to cost you more in the long run.

I could offer other advice, but I'll restrain myself.  :-)

Colin


>>>diy/general9 1920 hd(224)13mar10 23:04 c1899*m
Yer paze yer munny and yer taiks yer choice.

A good uPVC door is better than a bad timber one.

Me, I'd go for good wood, but that will probably cost more than good uPVC.


>>>diy/general9 1921 jwalton(311)14mar10 8:37 c1920*
I also made the point that a good uPVC door will have built-in draught 
proofing (if required), and not just a strip of foam rubber or brush! Some 
doors even have a draught sealing mechanism, whereby the door, once 
closed, can be "locked", to fully engage with the seals, under pressure.

John

Not too badly, if it's 'quarter sawn' but that is expensive and 'cheaper' 
items are made from 'plain sawn' wood, the nearer to the bark, the cheaper 
and most warp prone and often ends up being far more expensive by virtue 
of being moved, in the case of a door, from doorway to fire!

All to do with the wood shrinking as is dries and such 'movement' then can 
continue as the moisture content of the air it's in changes.

Just googling 'quarter sawn' brings up some pretty good illustrations, BTW.

A few years ago there were a lot of features regarding this on various 
consumer affairs programs and documentaries. The situation as I understood 
it at that time was that when it came to administering an estate the 
solicitor was notionally employed by the deceased and that nobody else -- 
not the other executors, not the beneficiaries, nobody -- had the legal 
power to challenge them over anything they did, even malpractice. Did I 
get that right, and is it still the case?


>>>enquire_within/8legal 3636 dcluley(562)13mar10 21:59 c3635
No.  The executors/administrators are the ones appointed to be the 
deceased's representatives.  They are the ones with powers and 
discretions.  Best course is to appoint trusted individuals to be 
executors.  They can then use solicitors and have the right to question 
and ask for accountability in everything the solicitors do.

Problems can arise where solicitors or banks are appointed directly as 
executors - mere beneficiaries are not in as strong a position to 
question or complain about the solicitors or banks, their actions or 
the lack of them.

HDRs are a type of photography. It stands for High Dynamic Range.

If you take a photograph inside a room pointing out a window then if you 
expose it for the daylight outside then the room is dark but if you expose 
for the room the daylight is bright white. HDR can expose the shot so that 
you have the outside and inside visible.

There are plenty of examples on the web but I tend to use the method for 
mostly church photography, inside and out.

There are also a variety of ways to both take and expose the photographs. 
One of the methods I use is to shoot in raw format and then use the raw 
software to expose 3 stops over then 3 stops under as well as the taken 
photograph and merge them together. Some do end up with a good effect.

http://www.flickr.com/photos/covltwt/2270350914/

However, the main option I do involves taking between 3 and 7 shots at 
differing levels of exposure on the tripod. Some results are better than 
others.

http://www.flickr.com/photos/covltwt/1095449170/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/covltwt/2879698425/

They both use the same method but are quite different. I get carried away 
with what I think the amount of colour should be and sometimes it goes 
pear shaped. However, the former of those two images were enough to 
astound the members of the church that saw them and I believe have been 
used now by the church for their use. I was careful with the copyright for 
them as well as their attitude of 'just give us the masters and we'll sort 
it out'

http://www.flickr.com/photos/covltwt/3299059390/ I have a non-cloud 
version that when shown together give people the impression I faked this 
picture. However, considering they were taken several hours apart and I 
had been inside taking photos usually calms them down. FYI I didn't and I 
don't think I know how to yet.

http://www.flickr.com/photos/covltwt/3299063568/ This one shows the point 
above which I made. If I had exposed for outside you wouldn't have seen 
the detail of the doorway.

Some photos are better than others. Some have been taken in a hurry or 
just didn't come out as expected.

No, you don't.

You are /ascribing/ logic to decisions /you/ have made - but 
extrapolating the particular on to the general (and on to a time 
several centuries before the umbrella was invented).

Our millennial serf didn't have an umbrella - he wore whatever he had 
available - /as a response to stimuli/ (he may have anticipated those 
stimuli, but that still doesn't require logic).

A 7-y-o might have behaved (or not), as a response to fear - tempered 
by a modicom of slyness (don't get caught).

You devalue the word and the concept by applying 'logic' to every 
decision you agree with.

logic, why do we keep fucking up?

"Harm" isn't the word, but distress might be.

I've no real sense of being on any crusade here - I'm just mightily 
curious. But I have to admit to a sense of sympathy for anybody who pops 
up in here, asks a question which might be very, very important to them, 
and gets an answer which is completely random.  

It would be good if I could understand why he does it! 

I mean, I've actually made up stuff myself, in the honest belief that I 
was repeating stuff I'd been told. I just misunderstood some of the info, 
got the wrong end of a couple of sticks, and synthesised something which 
was WAY off beam. But at the point where someone says: "Actually, Guy..." 
and illustrates the problem, my response changes (normally, extreme 
embarrassment!).

Neil's response seems to be: "I was right. I shot down someone in flames." 

What's more amazing, to me, is his claim to retract when he is caught 
making it up. He doesn't, does he? He justifies it.

Not an unforgiveable mistake; but I do wonder how anybody could have this 
much faith in bureaucratic efficiency, and give so little credibility to 
the direct statements of a known, honest and somewhat fussily meticulous 
source of personal information.

Is this how it works? We ask ourselves rhetorical questions, and decide 
that the "obvious answer" must be the facts? Do I actually do it all the 
time, without realising? How much of a gap between my own 
mis-apprehensions, and Neil's wild assumptions, really, is there? It seems 
to me to be very different! - but would I know?

If you're an experienced CIX citizen, you may well have a good perspective 
on how questions get answered. You may, nonetheless, tend to assume that 
if someone steps forward, speaking in an authoritative tone, then it's 
worth taking them seriously.

We all make mistakes. What makes him different is his insistence that they 
are not mistakes; and his further insistence that when they are, he admits 
it. I can't begin to guess what his intentions are, here; I assume

I can't believe that you think the big difference in use of logic between

Sure, but so what? Choices and decisions are made on the basis of 
preferences of aversions. Logic provides the process by which 
observations, propositions and assumptions are combined to come to the 
optimum decision.

Remember that in cix:2465 you said

> >Would a statement of the form "if ...then ..." 
> >or "if A then B, and if B then C, hence if A then C" involve logic?
> There's a bit more to it than that, but, yes.

The 7-y-o reasons as follows "If I am grounded, then I am unhappy; if I 
get home late, then I will be grounded, hence if I get home late I will be 
unhappy", and so potentially decide to make sure he gets home in time for 
dinner. You would seem to agree that this does involve logic.

Because we don't look at all the facts, because we make wrong assumptions,

I really think you have to understand that he brings it on himself.  If 
*any* of us stand up and say outrageous things, we tend to get lots of 
people attack what's been said.  In general (and apart from a few 
notorious individuals, and some very specific feuds) it is the comment 
that gets attacked, not the person, but persistent offenders do, and 
understandably, take some personal flak.  I've taken it myself on 
occasion, and on reflection it was probably justifiable, even if not 
actually justified!  :-)  Neil just happens to be more persistent, more 
outrageous, and more consistently persistently outrageous (IYSWIM) than 
anyone else on Cix.  If he doesn't like it, he could always desist ...

I'm surprised that Saga could increase the direct debit and not send out 
the corresponding, legally required, notification. It seems like a 
no-brainer to design the computer software so that the one forced the 
other. There shouldn't be scope for error.

In cix:2751 we learn it was a "technical error". That probably means the 
computer was down, or something; ie not a human error, not someone simply 
forgetting to do it. That they can now say this with confidence suggests 
it was something fairly major.

It's interesting that what Saga said in cix:2576, ie that they sent the 
letter to her new address, directly contradicts what they said in 
cix:2751. Even Saga thought they'd sent the letter, for a while. Mac 
repeated that twice. So it's not unreasonable for Neil to believe it too.


> give so little credibility to the direct statements of a
> known, honest and somewhat fussily meticulous source of
> personal information.

First of all, we don't all track each other's personality so closely. I 
have no idea whether Mac is "fussily meticulous". 

Secondly, and more importantly, saying Saga would have sent the letter 
does not cast aspersions at Mac. Lots of things could have gone wrong. We 
know she was moving house. Perhaps it got sent to the old address and 
wasn't forwarded correctly. Perhaps it got sent to the new address, and 
got wrongly forwarded to the previous occupant's new address. Perhaps it 
got sent during the postal strike and a temporary postal worker lost it.

Frankly, even suggesting that it did arrive correctly but that Mac somehow 
lost it during the aftermath of the move, isn't exactly a mortal insult. 
I'm surprised by how offended people are.


> Is this how it works? We ask ourselves rhetorical questions, and 
> decide that the "obvious answer" must be the facts? Do I actually 
> do it all the time, without realising?

I think most people automatically took Mac's side, and Neil went out of 
his way to consider Saga's side. And this is necessary and useful, in a 
dispute: to consider how things look from the other side, and how, when a 
mistake is made and damage done, it's not necessarily fair if it's the 
other side who have to pay for all of it. His assumptions here aren't 
wild, they are just different to other people's.

I also don't think he decided these were "the facts". His language is 
couched in probabilities. He doesn't say what she says is untrue, he says 
he finds it hard to believe. He gives reasoned justification for every 
step he takes. He's aware of the uncertainties.

There is probably an element of post-hoc rationalisation, and I do think 
that's universal. Humans are good at it; we're genetically engineered to 
speculate about mechanisms and possibilities. (Indeed, it's what we're 
doing when we try to imagine Neil's state of mind; we're doing to him 
roughly what he did with Mac, and probably about as erroneously).

And there's something called "confirmation bias", where-by we seek to 
confirm our theories instead of seeking to disprove them. Facts are rarely 
unambiguous and can usually be interpreted to fit, so they don't provide 
much of a reality-check.


>>>enquire_within/71general 2889 brangdon(377)14mar10 16:23 c2855*
Yes; it was a concerted effort on my part to resist the anti-Neil 
group-think. It bothered me, a little, that so many people believed he 
/had// called Mac a liar, when on reading the offending message it seemed 
to me he hadn't.

I do think there's a difference between bullying and a whole bunch of 
people speaking out at the same time. But it's easy to get carried away.

In the same sense as my electronics degree exams were a test of my having

Thank you! MY point precisely. 

Don't let the cricket subject distract you. It's going to apply to any 
situation in which you're comparing two sets, one of which is known in 
detail, and the other which is entirely unknowable. 

So the statement I picked up on - suggesting a statistically effect 
involving "the more white swans you see..." - is, I repeat, about as 
meaningful as "the higher you jump, the more you move earth." In a 
Universe where the Infinite Improbability Drive works, it has a meaning. 
We don't live there!

:-) yes and no.  I think of what's been going on WRT Neil as a 
manifestation of citizenship, of community responsibility.  

A case can be made out against such behaviour, in terms of it amounting to 
mob rule.  To a certain extent, I agree, but in a community which is 
lightly - perhaps even inadequately - policed, there is often in practice 
no viable alternative to citizen action.  When a user's activity is not 
merely irksome to individuals but damaging to the values and fabric of the 
community as a whole, then action does need to be taken to prevent further 
damage.  And it's possible to regard Neil's fairly consistent wrongness 
and refusal to acknowledge such as amounting in aggregate to a devaluation 
of the overall usefulness of CIX as a source of information and advice.

I'm well aware how dubious that sounds when viewed through the filter of 
real-life communities under the adequately enforced rule of reasonable 
law, and I wouldn't for an instant take such a line there.  I'm not 
entirely comfortable taking it here, either, but so be it.

Alternatively, if you'd care to view the Cix community overall as a 
self-correcting mechanism, then when informational malfunctions occur 
correction *does* need to take place, rather than simply ignoring them.

I'd also argue that the term "mob" can usually be as accurately applied to 
Cixen as the practice of herding can to cats :-)

No, I am saying he is responsible for his own actions and for the 
consequences that inevitably flow from them.

Do you *really* believe that if you stand up on Cix and spout nonsense 
nobody is going to point out to you the error of your ways?  And when they 
do, do you *really* believe you had nothing whatsoever to do with it?

When Mac declared, several times, that she had not been advised of the 
cost, and Neil then said "I find it very difficult to believe that Mac was 
not told of the cost", it's only a hair's-breadth away from calling her a 
liar. Maybe he meant to say "I find it surprising that Mac was not told of 
the cost", but he didn't.

Isn't that just the difference between someone saying something (Saga 
issued the advice, or presumed it had been issued automatically, but the 
software cocked up or it went astray) and someone saying they didn't hear 
it (the advice didn't arrive)? Granted it isn't the first interpretation 
that springs to mind, but it could well be the second

>>>enquire_within/71general 2903 cscott(1053)14mar10 21:59 c2888*m

One can keep picking bones out of the various messages from Mac and draw 
all sorts of conclusions that may - or may not, it makes little difference 
- be justifiable or even correct for as long as one likes, but ultimately 
it has to come down to how one reads cix:2570, which I accept is open to 
interpretation. 

However, what I find *the* most revealing aspect of this particular little 
sub-spat is that Neil has still yet to directly comment to Mac's cix:2578, 
in which she accuses him of accusing her of being a liar.  Instead he 
waited four days (during which he posted cix:2581, cix:2640, cix:2661 and 
cix:2691 on 3 separate days) until Mac posted her understandably (if 
somewhat regrettably) triumphalist cix:2751 before finally denying it in 
cix:2759 - and even then in somewhat equivocal terms.

Now, I know that Neil's reactions are often inexplicable, but I am pretty 
sure that if he had *not* been calling her a liar he would have protested 
his innocence PDQ and not waited several days for her to taunt him with it 
...

As there seem to be a number of people here who are interested in this, I 
thought I'd post the following, which is from the latest newsletter from 
the No2ID campaign, which started as a campaign to oppose ID cards and 
seems to be turning into a campaign to oppose all aspects of the 'database 
state'.

------------------------8<------------------------------

      + FIGHT FOR HEALTH RECORDS HEATS UP +

As we warned in Newsletter 141, the Department of Health is trying to roll 
out Summary Care Records to millions of patients before the general 
election. Those who have received mail shots now have less than 12 weeks 
to act, if they want to preserve their medical confidentiality.

The British Medical Association and GPs' leaders are deeply concerned and 
have told the government to stop letters being sent out to patients across 
England until they include an opt out form. Patients are being misinformed 
- not least about who will have access to their records [1] - and 
independent evaluators have noted that in the pilot areas 7 out of 10 
patients weren't even aware that a Summary Care Record had been created 
for them.

The Department is deliberately trying to make opt out difficult. Not only 
isn't the opt out form included in the information pack, you are supposed 
to phone a call centre for one, trawl the NHS website for a download (no 
direct link is given) or ask your doctor (who may have no forms, or know 
little about the process).

NO2ID and our colleagues at the NHS Confidentiality Campaign [2] are 
trying to make exercising your right to opt out simple and straightforward 
- and we need you to help SPREAD THE WORD.

Please tell everyone you know and, even if you've opted out already [3], 
download and print off copies of our updated leaflet which explains what 
is going on and provides an opt out letter for people to use: 
http://www.no2id.net/downloads/SCR_optout_sheet.pdf

And please do become a 'fan' of our new page on Facebook (the 'Info' 
section contains links to three other ways you can opt out) and pass it 
on: 
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Protect-Your-Medical-Confidentiality-ACT-NOW/
330345503401

--

Notes:

[1] The leaflet 'Changes to your health records' states that "anyone who 
has access to your records... must be directly involved in caring for 
you". THIS IS UNTRUE: the Department's own documents show that government 
officials and many others will have access "in the public interest", "by 
statute" (remember Clause 152!) or by court order.

[2] The NHS Confidentiality Campaign website is at 
http://www.nhsconfidentiality.org

[3] You do not need to opt out again. The NHS Confidentiality Campaign's 
and our opt out letter use the same mechanism to prevent your details 
being uploaded as GPs are currently being told to use. So if you have 
opted out already and haven't moved to a different practice, you should be 
fine. If for any reason your practice asks you to use the 'official' form, 
simply ask them to provide one - or to respect your clearly stated wishes 
in the form you have given, which provides all the same information. More 
than likely, your doctor is on your side.

Unknowable, or unknown? I'd say the latter. The population of swans in the 
whole world is not unknowable, but if it is unknown, then your sample of 
swans from (say) only one country will not allow you to draw a robust 
conclusion on it.

How would you count them exactly? Unless you counted each one at the same 
instant then some of those eggs will have hatched before you finished: but 
some won't, and some will have been eaten, and so on. Maybe the black ones

It sounds so easy, but if we're talking about the real world, then the 
means to do the counting has to be taken into account doesn't it?

I understand that. The old CIX habit of not answering the question 
actually asked is irritating enough but common enough whenever it occurs, 
that I no longer follow that thread, and it wasn't my focus here; for me, 
that was probably the more irritating aspect of the event, but not what 
caught my attention. (If you say: "I have broken a teapot, what glue 
should I use?" it's profoundly annoying to have someone who wasn't there 
say: "I bet it's not broken..." and you will become enraged with the 
apparent implication that you are stupid or lying).

My own experience of insurance companies leads me to find Mac's report 
entirely credible; I'm still surprised that others are saying otherwise. I 
suppose my experience includes rather more investigations, on behalf of 
readers, into such errors and omissions, than many. 

A reporter gets sucked into "exceptional" events like that and does come 
to understand the ease with which a bureaucracy can malfunction, and the 
difficulty of getting them to even investigate, never mind acknowledge 
such errors. They are a minority of events, yes; but it happens often 
enough to be *always* worth recognising that they are not just possible, 
but inevitable. 

Anyway, in this thread, the appearance of bullying was not one-sided. Neil 
was entirely entitled to ask: "Are you sure...?" but having been told 
"Yes, I'm sure" I think it was not appropriate to just keep on and on 
about how hard that was to believe. Mac was asking for specific advice. 
Having made it clear that Neil's advice was not helpful, I think she was 
harassed by him beyond the point of easy tolerance. All he had to say was: 
"I didn't intend to imply you deliberately lie, sorry; all I meant was 
that my experience suggests an error on your part..." and that would have 
been laid to rest. 

In fact, Neil's suggestions were all entirely speculative, and often, 
irrelevant or wrong.

cix:enquire_within/71general:2499 said: 
> Might have been a variable amount DD. 
- a dubious concept at best, without any basis in observable reality, and 
justified by a completely groundless "I would have thought..." - of no 
help of value in any context whatever, except to cast doubt on Mac's 
report, either her competence or her honesty. 
cix:enquire_within/71general:2507

Then Neil went on the attack, explicitly 
(cix:enquire_within/71general:2530) blaming Mac for the problem:

> I will argue that notwithstanding the failure to provide 
> (intentional or not) a paper copy of what was agreed, Mac was 
> responsible for not taking timely action to avoid the DD going 
> through knowing the consequences. Why didn't Mac query the missing 
> paperwork before it became an issue? Does anybody here really 
> believe that Mac is totally blameless as she readily admits her 
> mind was elsewhere?

And for good measure, Neil then threw in a little cod psychology to 
explain her culpability! 

Mac acknowledged and answered all his objections: 
cix:enquire_within/71general:2576
> 1. They say they sent the letter to my new address.  All mail has 
> been, and continues to be, forwarded by the Royal Mail anyway.
> 
> 2. They said they would phone me back with the revised premium. 
> They didn't, and they accept this.
> 
> 3. She would not tell me the new price, as she wanted to check with 
> the underwriting team.

...and asked Neil not to offer any more advice. He ignored the request, 
and added another accusation: "Then why didn't you chase SAGA for the 
premium before the payment?" - neither to the point, nor helpful, nor even 
hard to understand. 

Now, have a look at cix:enquire_within/71general:2563 where Neil is 
explicit:
> Do you think it was reasonable of her to think that she would be 
> covered at the existing premium when advised that a higher, albeit 
> unquantified if we believe Mac, one applied to her new residence?

and when challenged on "you don't believe her?" he confirmed that he 
didn't. In no way did he attempt to clarify this; he simply stated that 
her evidence was not credible. There was no "I'm sure it was an honest 
mistake on her part" or any suggestion that he'd even considered it; it 
was yet another attack on her competence and credibility, after being 
specifically asked not to offer more "advice" on the subject. I see Neil, 
here, as entirely unconcerned by any problem Mac is facing, and entirely 
focused on his own rhetorical justification for several entirely 
speculative, and several quite obviously incorrect assertions, taking the 
attack into a personal mode at the point where harassment shaded into 
bullying.

He still hasn't apologised for the apparent accusation of dishonesty, or 
attempted to clarify it as a suggestion of error. You did that, not him. 
His response - entirely in the opposite direction - is to accuse Mac of 
being irrational, and asserting that this relieves him of any need to be 
good-mannered: "Why should I dignify an irrational comment with a posting 
that adds nothing to the thread?"

In other words, Neil has made not a single attempt, throughout this, to be 
conciliatory or to appear understanding. He's been judgemental, obsessed, 
confrontational, and entirely focused on rhetorical self-justification. 

Neither his attitude, nor his style of posting, betrays any good heart. 
His motivations, as shown in his own words, are not attempts to be 
helpful. He simply wants to be acknowledged as some kind of authority in 
the matter; the feelings and frustrations of the person with the actual 
problem have not been acknowledged for a moment, except to be denounced as 
"irrational".

And, in the bottom line, he has shown himself not just to be indifferent 
to Mac's feelings, but wrong. All the "facts" and rhetorically implied 
probabilities he has advanced have been shown to be incorrect assertions 
or unjustified guesses based on limited understanding. 

You're quite right to point out that he did not specifically and 
explicitly accuse Mac of dishonesty. I admire you for doing so, in a 
somewhat heated discussion. 

But - seriously, what have you achieved? You've avoided having him lynched 
by a mob? No! - there were exasperated suggestions that he should get off 
the line, and that it was a wonder he'd lived so long - but we all know 
CIX! Nobody ever gets lynched. He was in no danger of being evicted from 
CIX. The moderator hasn't even threatened him with eviction from the 
conference, for goodness sake.

What you have done, though, is to persuade Neil that there is support for 
his approach; that he has been victimised, and that he has no need to 
re-assess his own behaviour. 

On balance, much though I'd like to praise you for being level-headed, I 
can't do so. I think Neil has caused real distress and anger to someone 
who merely needed informed advice, at a time of considerable personal 
stress. I think anybody with Neil's own best wishes at heart should 
seriously query the wisdom of giving him another opportunity to avoid 
dealing with an issue which really is beyond a personality quirk, and is 
verging on something which we'd be justified in being concerned about in a 
fellow CIXen. 

To me, it is obvious that Neil *does* *not* *understand* what it is he is 
doing. I won't attempt a diagnosis of why not. I do perceive it as a 
non-trivial problem for him, and if I can't actively help him with it I 
nonetheless am unhappy to see him diverted from confronting it...

Conciliation wasn't the priority, here.

Fundamentally, it doesn't seem to be referring to the topic we've been

scientifically, placebo disrupts data collection - and yet, equally 
scientifically, has no effect. Somewhere, there's a mismatch, in this.

I think it says that people report that they feel better but there are no

is basically, all the ones they can find that are robust enough to bother 
including). Feeling better is obviously better than not feeling better, 
but that's all that it is. I'm not sure that anyone *is* saying that 
placebo disrupts data collection - "no better than placebo" means just 
that and this isn't evidence that there is any effect down to placebo.

Ian,

I am sure that the posting I am commenting to is unintentional but I think 
most of those who are engaging on this line of twaddle are doing so out of 
ignorance of one thing - that disputes have two sides to the story. 

Courts, especially at Magistrate and County Count levels, are not the 
genteel places frequently portrayed in the artistic media with time for 
tea and a nice chit-chat before getting round to business but for the 
efficient disposal of what is at hand - if you are not quick enough, a 
hearing can be over before you have had time to put your bundle on the 
table. It is also not for the squeamish or arrogant - judges of all kinds 
are very swift at puncturing egos or grandstanders (and anyway civil 
matters (except libel & defamation cases AIUI) are not before juries) so 
you are dealing with somebody with a very wide discretion (based on the 
'balance of probabilities test) to infer things not in direct evidence. 
The one of the things judges really hate IME is being asked to turn the 
clock back because of dilatory attention to something that could have 
prevented the claim being brought in the first place even if it is to the 
advantage of the defendant (and Mac, accusing the Judge of being a liar 
will not do you any favours - all that it probably will result in is you 
being invited to appeal, with further up-front costs and an almost certain 
return invitation to continue as before in front of somebody who's 
sympathy you have irretrievably lost). It was simply her duty to ensure 
that SAGA didn't activate the DD as soon as practical after non-receipt of 
the promised return call and the missing paperwork to block the 
possibility of claim having to be made.

Almost invariably the original posting is posed along the lines that the 
noncixen has 'broken the law' to harm the cixen. I remember one thread 
where the cixen attempted to buy a CD player which he thought was 
attractively priced only to find that he had read the adjacent but 
relevant price ticket wrongly. There is the massive thread whereby 
somebody bought a house and through their own carelessness (I said 
recklessness) didn't check or understand EXACTLY what they were buying and 
thought that the courts would automatically force the developers to change 
the contract and that between them and another party, with attendant 
modifications) in their favour.

I also remember the theatre critic hereabouts who tried his luck on the 
boards and got a public panning for his troubles thinking, as a result of 
a TV item portraying him in not the best of lights, that he had the 
makings of a libel action to assuage his hurt feelings. Courts don't value 
feelings, hurt or otherwise. :(

One lady tried to suggest that because her well-used iPod failed she had 
the automatic right to an immediate replacement. A retailer might do so of 
their own volition, but customers do not have the legal right to demand it.

I further recall another cixen who spotted some televisions being offered 
new at a price well below market and tried to make a bit on the side, only 
to be thwarted when all he got was his money back (Courts don't work on 
what might have happened and damages are limited the minimum actual loss 
along with the fact that the original claim is ordinarily capped to the 
contract value).

Yes, you can negotiate an amicable settlement that is better than the 
court might have imposed which is preferable to having to spend time for 
the judge to call the parties together that invariably results in a 
pyrrhic victory, but it does require a flexible pleasant attitude, a bit 
of humble pie with courtesy and a knowledge of what is achievable - which 
often is a long way from what is their ideal outcome.

Neil.

I suppose the difficulty would be in establishing what the patient 
*really* believes about their treatment.  

Mrs teacup is very sceptical about conventional doctors,  having suffered 
from the pranks of medical students when she was at university (not a UK 
university, I am glad to say)  and reckons that they obviously could not 
have learned much since they were always bunking off lectures as well.  
Which ones?  obviously, the ones related to whatever she is suffering from 
at the time.   (She does not believe in Homeopathic Medicine either).

So, even if she can be persuaded to actually take the tablets, or 
whatever, to the end of the course of treatment,  there is probably some 
nocebo effect,  which just enforces her belief that the doctors were no 
good in the first place.

In my day as an undergraduate,  The Organic Chemistry course I went to was 
shared with the medical faculty, who were obliged to keep a record of 
attendance, (we were not).  So there was a notice above the register:  
"Medics Only Sign Here".

So that is what they did, just signed the book and went on their way,  
whilst we actually went to the lectures.

Once the decent members who tolerate those with different POVs leave or

You still don't get it do you. It's not your "different POV" that matters. 
It's bugger all to do with bullying. It's the fact that when several 
messages have shown quite clearly that you are just plain wrong, often 
factually wrong, you just clam up. You seem to find it impossible to admit 
that you were wrong, but you persuade yourself that you have admitted 
error. This last sentence is what intrigues/riles people.

The whole point of homeopathy is that the patient gets better by 
themselves. That's how it is supposed to work. So there is no way of 
telling the difference between a successful homeopathic treatment and 
getting better by themselves. There is no difference. 

Got it yet?

For someone who claims to understand, you do a good impression of someone 
who bull-headedly refuses to understand a thing.

That statement, in the face of repeated demonstrations to the contrary, is

I think at least one of those who are engaging in this line of twaddle is 
demonstrably ignorant of the reality that adducing *facts* rather than 
assumptions may sometimes influence the credibility of one or other side.  
Your recent spat with Mac is a fine example: there was evidence on one 
side of the case and none on the other, so you fabricated the other side 
out of thin air and maintained it even in the face of evidence to the 
contrary.  Belief on uncertain or deficient grounds is one thing: belief 
on no grounds whatever is quite another.

That'll be why you so often appear to refuse to give Cixen a hearing

I really think you may not be in the optimum position to make this 
observation.

> Mac, accusing the Judge of being a liar 

I'm sorry?  Where did this happen?  Are you equating yourself with the 
Judge?  I rather thought that her position (an over-reaction, but an 
understandable one) was that the opposite had occurred.  Really, Neil, I 
have no idea where on earth you think you're coming from here.

The critic in question was advised by a prominent libel lawyer that such a 
case lay, and had a contingency offer to pursue it, but decided not to.  
The panning in question consisted in large part of four- and five-star 
reviews of the actual show, as opposed to the slanted portrayal that 
resulted from ten months in the edit suite and a voice-over that 
fabricated a narrative.  Are you entirely sure you remember aright?

It's not just that your portrait of procedure here seems to me at least - 
and, I suspect, to others - radically at variance with your own conduct in 
conferences.  It's the fact that you can take stands about such petty 
points, such ridiculous points, and persist in them so obstinately.

I'm here deliberately recounting the most trivial matter I can recall, but 
your behaviour on it was no different from that on larger points, which 
suggests to me that the determining factor is neither gravity, legal 
standing, complexity nor a desire to advise, but a matter of your own 
attitude:

You've no doubt noticed my twitting you several times about your 
entrenched assertion some time ago that the former Conservative Prime 
Minister's name was Sir Alec Douglas Hulme, his title Lord Hulme.  You 
maintained this in the face of correction, and without citing any evidence 
whatever for your declaration, until I cited a number of authoritative 
sources including the Conservative Party itself to the effect that his 
name and title alike had always been Home, not Hulme.  You then simply 
fell silent, ignoring calls for you to acknowledge your error in any way 
whatever.

Where, in that case, was your
> bundle on the table
?  Where was your evidence that that matter had

> attention to something that could have prevented the claim being
> brought in the first place 
?  Where, when authoritatively corrected, was your
> flexible pleasant attitude, a bit of humble pie with courtesy and a
> knowledge of what is achievable
?  And if you're prepared to show such stubbornness, followed by such 
sullenness, over a matter as trifling as that, is it any wonder that your 
behaviour on more substantive points often strikes many as far from 
optimal?

Are you prepared, even now, to acknowledge your error on that point all 
those years ago, and admit that your position on the matter was mistaken 
and groundless?  Do you begin to see how your pontification at cix:1585 
may strike a number of readers as applying far more to you than to your 
interlocutors?

PMFBI but I think that is exactly what it is about.

I haven't got the slightest doubt with respect to your good intentions, 
but sometimes it is really quite strange to see how you turn (often wild) 
assumptions of your own into facts upon which you then build an argument; 
and subsequently when the invalidity of your assumptions is pointed out, 
you do indeed hang on to that 'untenable' position.

I can see why people are puzzled about that behaviour.

Whatever the merits of neil's arguments at least he makes one. I am far

But I can ignore that, just like people can ignore neil's posts. 

It might be good to remember that nobody here has a duty to be helpful or 
objective or correct, it's just somewhere to hang out. Saying that, a lot

themselves - Mike Todd for one - but they're dumped on too.

I always have a cold feeling of dread for absolutist positions...! 

:-)

First, you're assuming a competent, sane audience. That may not be the 
case. Example: life-saving, where you have rescued a drowning victim from 
very cold water. The mind of someone in hypothermia is not rational, and 
you can't explain quite obvious things. You have to trick them. My 
instructor told the story of a woman he'd pulled out of a frozen pond. She 
was safely in his rescue boat, and suddenly looked around for her handbag. 
It was at the bottom. "My handbag!" she screamed, and dived over to get it.

Frequently, the stress of the illness leads to anxiety, which badly 
affects the patient's ability to make a judgement. Other emotions equally 
cloud judgement. You have to consider: "Do I tell this person now? or do 
we wait for their mind to clear...? and in an emergency, it may not be an 
option.

There's also ignorance. You're telling someone information which conflicts 
with what they believe. You're right, they're wrong. But in their minds, 
the information is wrong, wrong, wrong, and maybe dangerously so. You're 
proposing a sedative injection without which they will go into shock; they 
perceive this as a life-threatening attack. You know you can administer it 
without their knowledge, or awareness. Do you really choose this moment to 
say: "Now, I'm going to give you a little injection..."? or do you save 
their lives?

Mostly, we're not discussing critical decisions like this, but the fact 
that the stakes are normally lower, doesn't mean that the issue is 
therefore irrelevant. My son-in-law eats tablespoons of Vicks Vapour Rub 
as a cure for colds; it doesn't kill him. I don't see it as clever! but 
I'm not under any illusion that I would be justified in telling him lies 
about what might happen, in an attempt to prevent his doing it. 
Nonetheless the issue does arise, and it isn't an issue I can resolve with 
a blanket "never!" absolute.

If it helps, I suspect we'd make the same decision 999 times in a 
thousand. But I can't make myself turn that into a Law.

In general, this is true.  Unfortunately, there are the disputes in which 
you participate where frequently you have a story which is out there all

One major vector of the PE is what people believe.
For example, people given dummy alcohol in different countries show 
different kinds of drunken behaviour, according to local behaviours.
And I hope you will have read the recent article here about ulcer 
treatment.
And there's the vector of traditional healing - the vast majority of which 
( including not only shamanism and so forth, but the  core western 
tradition) consists of placebo treatment.

feel better. So if we can't have the recovery, perhaps we should stick to

and as a result the NHS should be researching the placebo effect, how it 
works, what makes it work and how to make it work better, and not wasting 
money on mumbo-jumbo like homeopathy.

Which is where I came in...

We don't know that it does, and it might be that it's only helping people 
think that they feel better. There will be some placebo effect in a doctor 
telling their patient the truth (that there's nothing wrong that won't 
heal itself) - for some patients. 

Do you consider it ethical for a doctor to lie to a patient and say that 
this sugar pill might help and it turns out it doesn't?

The Cochrane report I've mentioned says that sham mechanical placebos are 
more effective than sham medication, but there's obviously a cost in 
providing them. Should we train lots of people to give sham procedures to 
deliver a non-treatment which will help some people, but only for some 
pain and some nausea?

But what are the alternatives? That's my context.

My objective, as a GP prescribing sugar pills, is to avoid seeing my 
patient do something destructive. I know that, given seven days on a sugar 
pill, they will have recovered entirely from whatever ails them.

But my patient isn't just gullible. My patient is convinced - by culture,  
experience, and other expectations - that they need Something Powerful - 
urgently. I may even know what they are likely to do; often, these 
patients are addicted to emetics, laxatives, aspirin, or just pretty 
random self-medication.

Some of the stuff you can buy, off the shelf, in a pharmacy, is really 
quite active biochemically; some is anodyne, but dangerous to apply (you 
would be astonished at the complications from Preparation H administration 
by people who don't understand intestinal parasites!).

Some consult herbal medicine dispensing shops, who include very toxic 
treatments in their range of products, and have little or no training in 
healing, and less experience. 

Some will *insist* on antibiotics, and if refused them, will go to another 
more pliable GP, and score them. 

And I could, I'm sure you realise, quote other examples...

In that context, I see it as a perfectly professional act: "Here is a 
prescription for a preparation I've used successfully for a half dozen 
patients this week. Make sure you take all seven pills." 

The patient does not always need to know it's a sugar pill; making that 
information available *after* successful treatment may be by far the more 
responsible tactic. It's quite possibly the only way to educate them.

That seems to me to be an even more difficult distinction - when does 
someone feel better, and when does someone merely /think/ he feels better?

The same will apply to lots of 'real' medicine, won't it?

I don't know - but we should be clear what it is we want to achieve: 
people that are more healthy, people that feel better, medics that tell 
the truth and nothing but the truth etc.

Minime (v2.0)

Useful little system tray application for those programmes that insist on 
minimising to the taskbar (particularly under Windows 7).

This requires no installation - just put it somewhere and create a 
shortcut to it.  I put the shortcut in the startup folder so it starts 
with Windows.

When run, it puts an icon in the system tray (green circle with a white 
downward arrow).  Any window you have open can be minimised to the Minime 
menu by pressing Ctrl-Shift-z.  If you then left or right click on the 
Minime icon, you will see a list of those programmes/windows which have 
been minimised in this way.

You can restore them individually from the Minime icon menu or restore all 
of them by pressing Ctrl-Shift-a, selecting "Show All" from the Minime 
menu or simply by closing Minime, at which point they all dutifully 
migrate back to the task bar.

Runs fine under Windows XP and 7 (64-bit).  Haven't tried it with other 
versions.

Oh, and it's freeware.

I've no idea whether it's supposed to be pronounced "minEEm" or "mini me", 
though.

Compatibility Mode
I've just found out that this does not include using previous versions 
of directx.

Although set to use XP SP2 BioShock 1 still would not run until I saw a 
comment on the net about using dx9. This can be done by either by going 
to start-games-bishock and right clicking for a menu option which says 
Play-DirectX9 or adding -dx9 to the target on the shortcut.

Not sure if I'm teaching grannies to suck eggs here but it may be 
useful to someone. :-)

Is now the time to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7?
Or is the informed view that we should wait a little longer?

I also have a laptop chugging along steadily on XP.

Ron S


>>>windows_7/general01 1117 ratcatcher(834)13mar10 15:13 c1116*m

My own view is this:

XP is stable and mature and if it's doing everything you want on the 
laptop it's running on, there's no urgent need to change.

Vista is probably one of the worst versions of Windows ever to get 
released.  If you're happy with the way Vista runs on your machine then 
again there's no urgent need to change.  On the other hand if, as is 
likely, it behaves like The Spawn of the Devil, then do upgrade.  Most 
machines capable of running Vista will also run Windows 7 without 
modification or issue (though of course the usual caveats apply: do check 
first).

This is exactly what I did.  I have one older laptop still happily running 
XP and another more recent one that I couldn't wait to remove Vista from.  
The latter is now happily running the latest version of Windows 7 
Professional 64-bit.


Nick


>>>windows_7/general01 1118 roman(1461)13mar10 15:17 c1116*m
The informed view, ever since Windows 7 came out, is that Windows 7 
thrashes Vista performancewise and in elegance of use.  Which indeed it 
does bigtime.

However, the more informed view is that you should first consider why you 
want to upgrade -- if everything (both with the Vista machine and the XP 
one) is working fine for you, there is a strong argument for leaving them 
alone.  Computers are just tools, after all, and if they are working...

As a decision point, anything with less than 2 Gb of RAM almost certainly 
isn't going to be man enough.  Also, consider your devices such as video 
card, printer, etc, and your important applications -- check that there 
are Windows 7 drivers for your hardware and that the software applications 
are compatible.  Windows 7 is pretty amazing for hardware recognition and 
support, but you need to check whether your exact models will be covered.  

Printers in particular can be an unwanted surprise, sometimes even if 
there is a Windows 7 driver, sometimes they've turned out to have a lot of 
the features missing from the new driver. 

64 bit is also something to consider.  It'll make more efficient use of 
memory above 3 Gb, but there can be hardware driver issues.

A good tip is to do a Google search for, say, your printer model, using a 
search string such, for example, as "HP Laserjet 4 Windows 7 problems" -- 
if there are issues, chances are somebody will already have encountered 
them.




>>>windows_7/general01 1119 hex(500)13mar10 15:59 c1116*m
An "upgrade" is almost always a waste of time.  Don't bother.

A "format and reinstall all your apps" is definitely worth it, if you can 
justify the cost of the software and your time.

However, as others have said, if your current installations are working 
well for you, then I'd probably wait until you replace your machines or 
something goes wrong.  If it ain't broke, and all that.  Don't believe the 
Microsoft marketing machine - you don't need Win7.  XP or Vista are fine 
for the moment.


>>>windows_7/general01 1120 ratcatcher(75)13mar10 16:09 c1119

As you are on Vista, it is almost a no-brainer IMHO (i.e. do it). And if 
Vista works, you are unlikely to have hardware problem (but check first).

As I don't think anyone has mentioned it, run the compatibility checker 
tool. And note that it tends to be very pessimistic / over-cautious!

I'd agree with that. We have left the three machines with XP as they are, 
which was just as well. We upgraded the laptop that was running Vista to 
Windows 7. Can't really compare the performance of Vista vs Windows 7 as 
we hardly ever used the laptop when it had Vista (which I think says it 
all!). There are problems, though, with our old HP scanner not working or 
supported by Win 7 and our HP 2200 duplex printer will not collate when we 
print multiple copies of multipage documents.

That's one I'll second!
Windows 7 recognised my Epson Stylus Color 760 and installed the driver 
for it, but it doesn't work properly.  I looked on Epson's website and 
the only driver for the 760, and several others, is the one supplied with 
W7.

Says it all really. If everything's running OK under the old OS, leave 
well alone until the driver probs are sorted might be the motto. Maybe 
with SP1.

Same can be said for Windows 2000, in most respects.


Windows 7, IMO, should be held until SP1, which is now due in December.

Why?  Do you have any Windows7-specific reasons for this claim?  Which 
specific Windows 7 issues -- if any --  have you personally encounterd 
which you are expecting to be corrected by SP1?

Or are you just automatically repeating the conventional Windows 
pseudo-wisdom that's been doing the rounds for the last two decades 
because everyone merely repeats what the last bloke said?

Do you have any basis for attacking me for giving my opinion?

Do you have any information that suggests that, actually, it's _not_ in 
fact my opinion and therefore I am not entitled to hold it?

I expressed an opinion. There are many things that Windows 7 does not do 
as well as XP right now. Hardware compatibility is just one of those 
things, as demonstrated in this very conference.

So yes, I am repeating the conventional wisdom, because it actually has 
some basis in fact. SP1 releases fix many of the problems reported by the 
early-adopters. This is not pseudo-wisdom, this is demonstrated fact since 
NT4. 

Get off your high horse.

Just out of interest, XP may support most of the peripherals that were 
around when it was released and all of the peripheral that were released 
during the next five, six, or seven years after it's release, but does it 
support as many peripherals that have been released in the last two years 
as Windows 7?

I have a new computer and instead of making it multi boot, have installed 
Windows 7 onto one hard drive and XP onto another, with the relevant 
drives disconnected while installing the other OS.  Redirecting the 
boot-up is then done via the BIOS, selecting the relevant drive as the 
priority one.

Quite apart from stability of W7 feeling *far* better, even with dozens of 
programs installed; hardly any in XP, the boot-up time for W7 seems far 
quicker than XP.  I've not done any stop-watch timings - nor do I intend 
to, since I'm away for a couple of weeks from tomorrow - but it *feels* 
like about half the time!

Which fixes, for which problems exactly, are you expecting from Windows 7 
SP1?  Any?

We're already well beyond the "early adopter" stage of Windows 7, and it's 
holding up extremely well.  Point is, you're not going to now get many 
updates for older drivers, particularly not from an SP.  (Nor indeed, are 
you going to now get many XP, let alone  earlier, drivers for hardware 
released since since Windows 7 came out.)  

"Waiting for SP1" is not for most users relevant to the question of 
whether or not one should upgrade to Windows 7 or not, and I think it 
really is time to drop that tired old cliche.

I acknowledge your opinion - A pity you couldn't simply acknowledge mine 
and made it into something which I perceived as a personal attack.

I have had to deal with no end of friends who have upgraded to 7 from 
either XP or Vista who want to rewind in the last 3 months that I now 
won't support either Vista (ever) or 7 (until SP1).

Anecdotally I have found that to be the case, too.  But (like many others, 
I suspect) I'm comparing a fairly new clean installation of Windows 7 on 
to a faster machine with an older install of XP on a slower machine with 
less memory.

A clean install of Windows 7 on the older machine would be an interesting 
exercise from the academic point-of-view though, as I said before, I'm not 
about to attempt it unless I have some compelling reason to do so.  For 
example, if the hard disk drive gave out and I had to replace it, I'd 
probably given 7 a try then.


Nick


>>>windows_7/general01 1135 kdavisa(822)14mar10 21:54 c1134
Yes Nick - but I'm comparing a clean install of W7 and a clean install of 
XP on the *same* machine, just on different hard drives as *alternative* 
booting rather than multi-booting.

I have several boot-time extras on the W7 system - Mailwasher, Clipmate, 
GoogleMail notifier, Second Copy, Digiguide - all that is ready to go far 
more quickly than XP with no extras.

About the only problem I had was with 64bit and Roxio Creator.  I use the 
Audio editor quite a bit and when using playback, there is no visual 
indication of where the track being played is.  Dropped back to 32bit  - 
(on the same machine) install and it's fine.  The one thing I've found 
that isn't (and it was working OK on my previous, 32bit computer) is 
javascript photo galleries in Serif's Web Plus. I have Serif looking into 
that.

Sounds like your friends have unfortunately been rather uncommonly unlucky 
with Windows 7 for some reason. 

Nevertheless, the wider body of opinion in the Windows community remains 
that Windows 7 is arguably the best version of the OS so far, and that 
there is no need whatsoever to do the mindless "wait for SP1" folklore 
dance.  It's ready to roll as it is.

That said, my personal advice would be to always do a clean install.  And 
in particular, not to even consider moving older machines (ie, more than a 
couple of years old) that are working fine as they are up to Windows 7.  
It's a contemporary OS for contemporary hardware, and attempting to 
retrofit Windows 7 to effectively obsolete and/or inadequate hardware is 
just going to bring grief.




>>>windows_7/general01 1138 kdavisa(700)15mar10 6:32 c1136*
Sometimes just not panicking can help!  On initially installing W7, that 
printer didn't show as supported.  Just when it was detected, I can't say 
- but it was during the next few hours.

I also have an Epson Aculaser C-900 and that is also recognised but they 
don't list the very handy Status Monitor for is under W7.  The have it for 
use under Vista, though, so I tried it and got the info that it wasn't for 
use under W7 and the install failed.  I asked Epson who said they didn't 
supply it for W7 - there is one for Vista that /might/ work.  I tried 
installing it again - and it now works!

ISTM that much support *is* available.  It can just take a bit of time for 
it to be found.

On a slightly different tack, can anyone see objections to a Win 7 
*Ultimate* upgrade over the top of a fresh Win 7 64-bit *HP* install?  ie 
on a new PC, direct from the manufacturer with 64-bit HP on it. That 
could save basic driver location issues for the new machine.

Have to confess I'm sure how this works. Is it the case that all versions 
of 7 are installed, you just have to unlock the one you paid for with the 
relevant key.

>>>windows_7/general01 1144 jwalton(423)15mar10 8:24 c1143m
Sorry, can't answer the question, but you may find you can do a clean 
install, and that HP have a "pack" of updates specifically for your PC 
under Win 7.

That's what I did with my Toshiba NB200, I just installed their "Toshiba 
Software Installer for Windows 7". This installs the special drivers for 
such things as the auto-detect hard disc jog and lock, and the touch pad, 
power management etc.

Best Regards,

>>>windows_7/general01 1145 roman(816)15mar10 9:53 c1143
> Win 7 *Ultimate* upgrade 

All the Windows 7 versions are the same in terms of installation, but 
which version you receive is decided by the serial number.  You can 
"upgrade" by changing the serial number to that of Ultimate: 

Highlight Computer (desktop or start menu)
Right click
Properties

Windows Activation
"Change Product Key"

The question though is, apart from the drivers, what other crapware, 
sampleware, dodgy antivirus, useless applications, etc have HP 
pre-installed? 

It might be as well to start with a wipe and reinstall of only the stuff 
you actually want -- but if you do, make sure you have at least the 
network drivers downloaded to another partition or to (unzipped) to a DVD 
or CD.  If you have at least those, all the others you can get from the HP 
site and install them online.


>>>windows_7/general01 1146 kdavisa(823)15mar10 10:07 c1142*
Agreed, again 100% - with one caution.  Make sure that certain programs 
are uninstalled first.  Some companies have a peculiar attitude to 
activation.

Adobe seem OK.  If you're re-activating on the same computer, no problem 
but on a different one, un-installing can roll back the activation.  
Nuance, OTOH just apply a ration and each install, even on the same 
computer, unless uninstalled , which does roll back the activation count, 
will use one of the ration.  Same with F-Secure - using one of the ration, 
that is.  With them, there is no roll back!

Both Nuance and F-Secure, though, will listen to reason and set back the 
activation count - which is the least they should do, I'd say, considering 
that their policy otherwise takes no account of the possibility of a hard 
drive tying itself in knots!

You're right.

Overall, I gave up on Adobe ages ago.  'OK' is *only* in respect to the 
activation, *compared* to Nuance and F-Secure, in that roll back is there 
for the asking - indeed, if you uninstall the CS suite, there is a prompt 
asking if you want the activation rolled back.

What they are *not* OK about, the same as the others, is a disk crash and 
they are less amenable on the phone.

They were also not OK, I've just remembered, with their trial of CS3.  
They sold it for about a tenner, ISTR, redeemable on purchase of full 
product.  Fair enough, except that the 30 days it was supposed to run for 
showed as 30 days on day1 and as 'expired' on day 2! Phoning to complain 
get the response, 'Sorry, it happens'!
