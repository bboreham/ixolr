                <h2>How it works</h2>
<p>iXolr is an Off-Line Reader or OLR: it connects to CIX from time to time to download any new messages, and stores them in a local database on your iPad or iPhone. iXolr can be set to download automatically every two minutes, or only when you touch the ‘sync’ button.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each message belongs to a thread of conversation, within a topic, within a conference.
    </li>
    <li>After you read a message, touch the ‘Next Unread’ button at bottom-right to move to the next unread message.
    </li>
    <li>Some messages are considered ‘priority’: they are messages which you have authored, or any subsequent comments to a priority message. You can skip forward to new unread priority messages with another button.
    </li>
    <li>You can enter new messages either as comments to existing messages or as a brand-new conversation thread. After entering a message it sits in the Outbox until you touch the Sync button.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>iPad Main Screen</h2>
<p>The key areas of the main screen are shown here:</p>
<img src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/Slide1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 504px; width: 672px; ">
<p>The top-level list is the CIX conferences you are joined to and have downloaded messages from. When you touch to select a conference, the view shifts to show the topics within that conference. Touch to select a topic and all message threads in that topic will appear on the right-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>(This is the view when you hold the iPad horizontally, in ‘landscape’ orientation. Holding it vertically gives a similar view but the left-hand list pops in and out as needed)</p>

<p>‘My Messages’ shows all the messages you have posted in the last few months.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/Comference Actions screen shot.jpg" alt="" style="height: 218px; width: 190px; ">
    If you hold your finger down to do a ‘long press’ on a conference name you will get access to a menu with options to mark all messages in that conference as read, or to resign the conference. If you have already resigned a conference you get options to re-join or to delete all record of the conference from the local database.</p>


<p><img class="screenshot" src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/Topic actions Screen shot.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em auto; height: 185px; width: 188px;">
            ‘Long press’ on an individual topic gives you the option to mark all messages in that topic as read, or to download more messages from CIX to back-fill from before you started using iXolr.</p>

<p>‘Mute topic’ means that any new messages in that topic will be marked as Ignored, so they do not show up as unread. This is useful if there is a topic you don’t ever read, but you still want to remain joined to the conference it is in.</p>

<div style="clear: both"><p></p></div>

<h2>iPhone Screens</h2>
<p>The iPhone version uses the same components, but switches the display from conference view to topic view to threaded message view.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/Slide2.jpg" alt="" style="height: 504px; width: 672px;"></div></p>
<h2>Threaded view</h2>
<p>At the top-right of the iPad screen, or full-screen on the iPhone, is a one-line summary of every message in the current topic. The text is indented to show which messages comment to which previous message. If you click on a line within this view then the whole message will display below. Messages are shown in bold if they are the root of a thread, and shown darker when they are unread. Messages are only marked as read when you move forward with the ‘Next Unread’ button, so merely clicking on a message in the threaded view will not mark it as unread.</p>

<p>Touching on the grey header bar for a thread expands or contracts all the messages in the thread. ‘Long press’ on the header lets you mark an entire thread as read, or mark it as ignored so you won’t see any new messages in that thread - they will all be marked as read when downloaded.</p>

<p>The bar between thread summary and message view panes can be moved up and down by dragging on the up/down arrow symbol at the right. Next to that is a ‘star’ button which marks the current message as a favourite so you can find it again in the ‘Starred’ folder at top level.</p>
<p><img class="screenshot" src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/Outgoing Msg Icons.png" alt="" style="height: 67px; width: 161px;"></p>
<p>If the current message is in the Outbox awaiting upload to CIX, two more buttons are shown instead of the star button - Lock, which keeps the message held in the outbox until you unlock it, and Edit.</p>

<p>On an iPhone, the message display has two options for how the main buttons are displayed, which you can choose between in Settings. The default is to have a toolbar at the bottom of the screen; the other choice is to have the ‘Original’, ‘Last Read’ and ‘Next Unread’ buttons floating and transparent so the full height of display is available to read the message. In this mode, tap in the middle of the screen to make them appear, and tap again to make them disappear.</p>

<h2>Toolbar Buttons</h2>
<p>The Reply button <img src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/UIButtonBarReply.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 17px; width: 21px; "> brings up a menu to reply to the current message or post a new message.</p>
<p><div style="height: 315px; width: 210px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 315px; margin: 12px 12px 12px 0px; position: relative; width: 210px; "><img src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/iOS Simulator Screen shot 3 Nov 2012 17.55.29.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 315px; width: 210px"></div></p>
<p><b>Reply via CIX</b> - begin editing a message which will be a comment to the current message, to extend the thread of conversation. </p>

<p><b>Reply via email</b> - fires up the iOS email editor, pre-filled with the email address of the current message author. Requires an Internet connection to fetch the email address, and requires that email is set up on your iOS device.</p>

<p><b>Share...</b> - this button is present only on iPhone running iOS 6.0 or later; it opens the action sheet as described under Action button below.</p>

<p><b>Start new thread</b> - begin editing a message which, when uploaded, will form the root of a new thread of conversation in the current topic.</p>
<p><div style="height: 231px; width: 240px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 231px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 240px; "><canvas width="249" height="240" style="position: absolute; top: -3px; left: -3px;"></canvas><img src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/iOS Simulator Screen shot 4 Nov 2012 23.23.12.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 231px; width: 240px; opacity: 0;"></div></p>




<p><div style="height: 17px; width: 25px;  height: 17px; position: relative; width: 25px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block"><img src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/Action button.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 17px; width: 26px; "></div>
The Action button on iPad opens an action sheet that lists services such as SMS, Mail, and Twitter (if you have them configured) that act on the current message, e.g. copying the message text into a new SMS message ready to send.</p>

<p>Touching the message header, where the message number, author and date are displayed, brings up the Message Actions menu:</p>
<p><div style="height: 315px; width: 210px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 315px; margin: 12px 12px 12px 0px; position: relative; width: 210px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_5 inline-block shadow_3"><canvas width="219" height="324" style="position: absolute; top: -3px; left: -3px;"></canvas><img src="./iXolr 3.9 Main_files/iOS Simulator Screen shot 3 Nov 2012 17.58.38.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 315px; width: 210px; opacity: 0;"></div>
<b>Withdraw message</b> - used when you realise you have posted in error, and you want to remove a message you have previously posted from CIX. </p>

<p><b>Mark read</b> - mark the current message as read (or unread, if it is currently marked as read)</p>

<p><b>Mark priority</b> - mark the current message and all comments in the thread as ‘priority’. </p>

<p><b>Mark ignored</b> - mark the current message and all comments in the thread as ignored, so they will not show as unread. Use this when you find the conversation boring.</p>

<p><b>Copy cix: link</b> - copy to the iPad clipboard a string of the form ‘cix:conference/topic:number’. If you paste this link into a message then it can be followed like a URL in iXolr and other CIX OLRs, or in the online CIX Forums.</p>


<h2>Outbox</h2>
<p>When you create a new message in iXolr, it sits in the Outbox until you next touch the ‘sync’ button. From the Outbox you can edit messages by clicking the blue arrow, or delete them by swiping to the right. </p>

<p>You can hold messages in the Outbox using the padlock icon on the message header. This is useful if, for instance, you want to check a fact before posting.</p>

<h2>Forums and Other OLRs</h2>
<p>The message-read status will be uploaded to CIX, so Forums, CIX Reader and any other clients using the CIX API should be in sync when they download. Ameol and other non-API readers maintain their own status so will not be in sync. The command ‘Sync Unread with CIX’ will change the message-read status held by iXolr to match the last-downloaded message from CIX.</p>

<h2>Hardware Keyboard</h2>
<p>If you have a keyboard connected to your iPad then you can use shortcut keys to navigate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter - go to next unread message</li>
    <li>5 - go to next unread priority message<li>
    <li>Up/Down arrow - previous/next message in topic</li>
    <li>Left arrow - go to root of thread or root of previous thread</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">Right arrow - go to root of next thread</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">O - go to Original message, that current message is a comment to</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">P - toggle Priority status on current message and follow-up messages in thread</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">I - toggle Ignored status on current message and follow-up messages in thread</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">S - create a message to start a new thread (‘Say’)</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">C - create a message to comment on the current message</li>
    <li><span class="style_1">T - upload/download new messages to/from CIX</li>
</ul>
