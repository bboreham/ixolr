# iXolr - CIX Offline Reader

iXolr is an iPhone and iPad app for [CIX Conferencing](https://www.cix.uk/forums/), one of the first social networks. CIX has hundreds of conferences where people communicate via text messages in a moderated, spam-free environment.

An off-line reader is like an email client, allowing you to grab the latest messages in a quick burst, then read them off-line at your leisure. It optimises your bandwidth usage, gives you a user experience tailored to the iPad, and lets you work in places where you donâ€™t have a network connection.

You must have a CIX account in order to use iXolr.

Features include:
* Download and read messages, organised by topic and conference
* Threaded message display
* Create new messages and upload them to CIX
* Search messages within a topic
* OAuth security, so you control your password and access
* View and search the directory of all CIX conferences.
